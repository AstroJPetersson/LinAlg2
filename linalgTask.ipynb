    "# Linear Algebra Project: Special Relativity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will investigate the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity\"> Special Theory of Relativity</a> (SR), formulated using linear algebra. Those of you who have previous learned about SR have possibly heard terms like 'four-vector' tossed around. In fact, one of the great insights of SR was that one, in order to make a proper description of motions, needed to treat space and time on equal footing, and thus write the whole theory with vectors that also has a time component.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often the case that one can solve a problem in one \"frame\", but want the result in another. To transform a result (a position or velocity, represented as a vector) from one frame to another, linear algebra is used. Linear algebra is really a good language for theories of motion, especially relativistic theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are exercises written in the text. You should add your answers in a new cell below the exercise. Some exercises require you to do some pen and paper math, this should be properly explained in the answer. You can write latex math in the notebook using `$` delimiter, just double-click on any math in the intructions to see examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some exercises require you to do some coding in python and make figures. The code must be executable in the notebook, and should produce desired figures/results/etc. when executed. The code is also expected to be legible, with sensible variable names, and adequately commented.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise consists of three parts, as numbered sections in this notebook. The three parts are\n",

    "   2. Derivation of the Lorentz transformation  \n",
    "   3. Relativistic aberration    \n",

    "Before going to SR, it is useful to introduce the central concepts in the context of ordinary classical mechanics. Transformations between corrdinate systems moving with a constant speed wrt. each other, are called Galilei transformations, after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei\">Galileo Galilei</a>.\n",
    "Given two systems, $S$ and $S'$, where $S'$ is moving with the velocity $v$, along the $x$-direction, with respect to $S$, we have a linear relationship between the space-time coordinates of the two systems:\n",

    " \n",
    "It is trivial to see, that a transformation with velocity only in the $x$-direction has no influence on the $y$- and $z$-coordinates, and we write here only *one* space coordinate ($x$) (as it simplifies notation). Transformations with respect to velocities in the $y$ and $z$ directions are of course similar.\n",

    "\n",
    "Write in python a class representing a two-vector in space, *i.e.* the position vector $(x,y)$ or equivalently $(v_x, v_y)$, the velocities in the two directions. Since the $t$ component does not transform, it should not be included, but you may have to consider it in some of the methods anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class should include the following methods:\n",
    "* A constructor taking an $x$- and $y$-coordinate as argument.\n",

    "A good example of effects from such coordinate transformations, is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_of_light\">aberration of starlight</a>. When we observe a star from earth, which is moving with a velocity with respect to the star, the apparent position of the star depends on the velocity of the earth -- see the figure (from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Simple_stellar_aberration_diagram.svg\">Wikimedia commons</a>).\n",
